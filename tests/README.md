Yes, it's a good practice to keep API and UI tests organized separately within the tests folder. Here's an example of how you could structure your tests folder:

tests/
├── api/
│   ├── authentication/
│   │   ├── test_api_authentication.robot
│   │   ├── test_api_authentication_data.csv
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── users/
│   │   ├── test_api_users.robot
│   │   ├── test_api_users_data.csv
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── README.md
├── ui/
│   ├── login/
│   │   ├── test_ui_login.robot
│   │   ├── test_ui_login_data.csv
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── homepage/
│   │   ├── test_ui_homepage.robot
│   │   ├── test_ui_homepage_data.csv
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── README.md
└── README.md

In this example, there are two subfolders under tests:

- api: Contains test suites for API testing.
- ui: Contains test suites for UI testing.

Within each subfolder, there are further subfolders that group the test suites by functionality or component being tested. Each test suite may have its own test data file and README.md file that describes the purpose and contents of that test suite.

This structure allows you to easily locate and run the relevant tests when working on a particular feature or functionality. Additionally, it makes it easier to maintain and update the tests as the project evolves over time.

Overall, organizing your API and UI tests separately within the tests folder can help you keep your Robot Framework project organized and make it easier to maintain and scale over time.
